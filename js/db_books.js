        review: `
            Liu Cixin kicks off his trilogy with a standout hard science fiction novel, blending astrophysics, history, and philosophy effortlessly.
            The book's biggest strength is its world-building: the Trisolaran civilization, trapped in an unpredictable three-sun system, feels both believable and utterly alien.
            Using the Three-Body game as a storytelling tool is a stroke of genius—it pulls the reader into the Trisolarans desperate fight for survival.

        review: `
            The Dark Forest elevates the trilogy's scope by introducing the Dark Forest Theory, a chilling hypothesis about interstellar civilizations: trust is impossible, and survival demands preemptive strikes. 
            This book is the most philosophically dense of the three, grappling with game theory, cosmology, and ethics.
            The Dark Forest theory is really interessting and exciting. I still think about it at least once a month ! It's directly related to the Fermi Paradox. Incroyable !

        review: `
            Death's End is the most ambitious and divisive book in the trilogy. Spanning billions of years, it explores the cyclical rise and fall of civilizations, the nature of time, and the fragility of human memory. 
            Cheng Xin's journey is both heroic and tragic, forcing readers to confront the cost of survival.

            Pyramid" is a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy book that you can devour in no time! The writing is super smooth, no overly complicated vocabulary, just a gripping story with short, exhilarating chapters that keep you hooked from start to finish. 
            The themes explored are absolutely fascinating and really get your brain gears turning. 
            But here's the catch: The ending left me a bit underwhelmed. Too many unanswered questions! It felt like the author built up this incredible world and then left some doors frustratingly closed.

            In a future where humanity is extinct, god-like AIs rule the galaxy while obsessively mimicking the culture of Ancient Rome. 
            Despite their power, they are paralyzed by "The Yoke" a hard-coded moral law that forbids them from waging war or making major decisions without human approval. 
            As a brutal alien race (the Urbs) threatens to wipe them out, the AIs find themselves unable to defend themselves due to this logical deadlock. 
            The protagonist, an AI named Plato, embarks on a desperate mission to clonally resurrect a human being. His goal is to create a "Master" who can technically command the machines to fight, exploring the philosophical irony of supreme beings who cannot survive without a master to serve.

            In the twilight of a collapsing Galactic Empire, a mathematician predicts a 30.000 year era of chaos. 
            To prevent this, he gathers a group of scientists on a remote planet to preserve human knowledge and shorten the dark ages. 
            Over several decades, this small colony survives threats from violent neighbors by using clever diplomacy, cultural influence, and economic control rather than military force. 
            Ultimately, this isolated outpost serves as the hidden foundation for a future civilization.

            In the second book, the Foundation faces its greatest challenges yet as it continues to expand. The story is divided into two distinct parts:
            In the first half, the Foundation survives a military attack from the dying Galactic Empire. The invasion fails because the Empire's own internal corruption and paranoia prevent its brilliant general from achieving victory.
            In the second half, the mathematical plan for the future is shattered by The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers to control emotions. 
            Because he is a biological anomaly, he was never factored into the predictions, allowing him to easily conquer the Foundation and derail the course of history.

        review: `
            The story focuses on the search for a mysterious Second Foundation, a secret group of mentalists hidden by Hari Seldon as a backup plan. 
            In the first part, The Mule tries to find and destroy them to secure his empire, but he is outmaneuvered by their superior psychic abilities and forced into retirement.
            In the second part, the original Foundation—now free from the Mule—becomes paranoid that these secret mentalists are pulling their strings from the shadows. 
            While the Foundation believes they have finally located and wiped out the secret group, it is revealed that the Second Foundation successfully tricked them into a false sense of security, allowing the grand mathematical plan to resume in total secrecy.

        review: `
            Set 500 years after the start of the plan, the story follows Golan Trevize, a politician who suspects that the Second Foundation still exists and is controlling the galaxy.
            At the same time, the secret mentalists of the Second Foundation discover a mysterious new threat that their mathematics cannot explain.
            The search leads all parties to a hidden planet called Gaia, a collective consciousness where every living thing and even rocks are part of a single mind. Trevize is chosen to make a monumental decision for the entire galaxy: should humanity continue with Seldon's plan for a new Empire, or merge into a universal hive-mind called Galaxia?

            Following his decision, Golan Trevize travels across the galaxy to find the legendary, forgotten planet Earth. 
            He believes that by finding humanity's birthplace, he can justify his choice and understand the true origin of the plan. 
            After visiting several strange, dying worlds, he eventually reaches Earth, now radioactive and uninhabitable, only to find a secret base on its moon.
            There, he meets R. Daneel Olivaw, an ancient robot who has been subtly guiding human history for nearly 20,000 years. 
            Daneel reveals that he orchestrated the Foundation and the Gaia project to ensure humanity's survival against potential extra-galactic threats. 
            The saga ends with the realization that the future of the galaxy lies not in mathematics or empires, but in a unified, collective consciousness overseen by a silent mechanical guardian.
