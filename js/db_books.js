        review: `
            Liu Cixin's debut in the trilogy is a tour de force in hard science fiction, seamlessly weaving astrophysics, history, and philosophy. 
            The novel's greatest strength is its world-building: the Trisolaran civilization, trapped in a chaotic triple-star system, is a masterclass in creating an alien society that feels both plausible and deeply foreign. 
            The use of the Three Body game as a narrative device is ingenious, immersing the reader in the Trisolarans desperate struggle for survival.

        title: "3 Body Problem: Dark Forest",
        author: "Liu Cixin",
        score: "5/5",
        status: "READ",
        review: `
            The Dark Forest elevates the trilogy's scope by introducing the Dark Forest Theory, a chilling hypothesis about interstellar civilizations: trust is impossible, and survival demands preemptive strikes. 
            This book is the most philosophically dense of the three, grappling with game theory, cosmology, and ethics.
            The Dark Forest theory is really interessting and exciting. I still think about it at least once a month ! It's directly related to the Fermi Paradox. Incroyable !

        author: "Liu Cixin",
        score: "4/5",
        status: "READ",
        review: `
            Death's End is the most ambitious and divisive book in the trilogy. Spanning billions of years, it explores the cyclical rise and fall of civilizations, the nature of time, and the fragility of human memory. 
            Cheng Xin's journey is both heroic and tragic, forcing readers to confront the cost of survival.

        title: "Pyramides",
        author: "Romain Benassaya",
        score: "3.5/5",
        status: "READ",
        review: `
            "Pyramid" is a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy book that you can devour in no time! The writing is super smooth, no overly complicated vocabulary, just a gripping story with short, exhilarating chapters that keep you hooked from start to finish. 
            The themes explored are absolutely fascinating and really get your brain gears turning. 
            But here's the catch: The ending left me a bit underwhelmed. Too many unanswered questions! It felt like the author built up this incredible world and then left some doors frustratingly closed.
